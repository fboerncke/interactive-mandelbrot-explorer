# Mandelbrot Explorer

Welcome to the Mandelbrot Explorer project! This Python application allows you to interactively explore the Mandelbrot set, a beautiful and fascinating fractal. You can zoom in on any area of the set to reveal infinite complexity and unexpected beauty.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to run the Mandelbrot Explorer on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

The Mandelbrot Explorer requires Python 3.6 or later. You will also need the following Python packages:

- numpy
- matplotlib

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

To run the Mandelbrot Explorer, simply execute the Python script `mandelbrot_explorer.py`:

```bash
python mandelbrot_explorer.py
```

This will open a window displaying the Mandelbrot set. You can select a rectangular area to zoom in by clicking and dragging your mouse. The application will redraw the Mandelbrot set for the selected area.

## How It Works

The Mandelbrot set is a set of complex numbers `c` for which the function `f(z) = z^2 + c` does not diverge when iterated from `z = 0`. This application calculates the Mandelbrot set by iterating over each pixel in the image, treating the pixel coordinates as complex numbers, and determining whether the function diverges.

The application uses the numpy library to efficiently handle the complex number calculations and the matplotlib library to display the Mandelbrot set and handle user interactions.

## Learning from This Project

This project is a great way to learn about fractals, complex numbers, and interactive graphics in Python. Here are some key concepts you can learn:

- **Fractals**: The Mandelbrot set is a fractal, a mathematical set that exhibits a repeating pattern at every scale. Fractals can be found in nature and are used in computer graphics to create complex shapes and textures.

- **Complex Numbers**: The Mandelbrot set is defined in terms of complex numbers. This project shows how to perform complex number calculations in Python using the numpy library.

- **Interactive Graphics**: This project uses the matplotlib library to create an interactive graphical application. You can learn how to draw images, handle user interactions, and update graphics in response to user actions.
